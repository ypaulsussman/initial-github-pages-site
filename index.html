										<h3>GitHub.</h3>
                    <p>Here you can find my software projects: I've pinned the more expansive codebases (as well as those with live accessibility), but I try to keep everything I've worked on public here. </p>
                    <p>Really, you can think of my repos as my technical blog. I'm absolutely in love with GitHub; I try to equip each of my projects with detailed, generous documentation, including at least a few sentences about what I'd learned from building that codebase. If you want to trace my development as a programmer, error by error and lesson by lesson? Here's the best place to start.  </p>

									<h3>LinkedIn.</h3>
									<p>Prior to retraining as a full-stack engineer, I'd spent just over 12 years in the education field. I'd worked at universities, refugee resettlement centers, native-mobile startups, and more: it was a delight.</p>
									<p>While I'm personally ready for new ventures, the register of that professional experience - what I accomplished, and when, and how - is all available below. Go ahead: take a look. I didn't rent that bowtie for my own enjoyment... </p>

                      <h3>About Me.</h3>
                      <p id="linkedInBoilerplate"><em>An expert communicator and passionate builder, I’ve spent the last twelve years developing the best language-learning experience for a given situation. Whether as an instructor, teacher-trainer, curriculum-designer, manager, and more, I’ve always always sought the perfect integration of pedagogy with technology. Having spent the first half of 2017 transitioning fully into the “technology" half of that equation, I’ve recently completed Prime Digital Academy’s full-stack software developer program. I’m now looking to work with a committed team on meaningful, human-centered web applications. Outside the professional sphere, I care about about helping and welcoming new Americans, the structure(s) of language(s), and human capital in all its forms. (Friends might add, “...also board games, soccer, and museums.”)</em></p>
                      <p>OK, that's just the LinkedIn bio. </p>
                      <p>It's all true, though! The only things to add, I suppose, are the two reasons for moving out from NYC to Minnesota some months ago, in late 2015.</p>
                      <p>First reason: I missed forests, and trees. Now? I can get them whenever I want, and I've become more committed to watching their backs. (They can't, themselves.)</p>
                      <p>Second reason: in its munificence, the State of New York provided a paper in 2013 allowing me to file taxes jointly with my best friend. (We had a big party afterward.) Spousal choices aside, she is <em>way</em> smarter (and cooler) than me. Want to know about data science? Data visualization? Pickles? <a href="http://zoelzh.com/">Head thataway.</a></p>
